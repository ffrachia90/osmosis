# 💼 Osmosis - Sales Pitch

## Elevator Pitch (30 segundos)

**"Osmosis automatically migrates ANY legacy codebase (JSP, PHP, ASP, etc.) to modern React/Angular/Vue using AI. What takes 18 months manually, we do in 3 weeks - saving you $2M per application."**

---

## The Problem (Pain Points)

### For Enterprise IT Leaders

**"You have dozens of legacy applications built 20 years ago that:**
- ❌ **Cost millions to maintain** (old developers retiring, hard to hire)
- ❌ **Block innovation** (can't integrate modern tools)
- ❌ **Risk security** (outdated frameworks with known vulnerabilities)
- ❌ **Take 12-24 months to rewrite** manually
- ❌ **Cost $1-5M per app** to migrate

**Every quarter you delay costs you:**
- $50K-$200K in maintenance
- Lost business opportunities
- Competitive disadvantage
- Technical debt compounding

## ROI Calculator

### Example: Regional Bank with 10 Legacy Apps

**Current Cost (Manual Migration):**
```
10 apps × 18 months × $100K/month = $18M
Time to complete: 15 years (sequential)
Risk: Very High (rewrite from scratch)
```

**With Osmosis:**
```
10 apps × $250K = $2.5M
Time to complete: 30 weeks (parallel possible)
Risk: Low (automated testing)

SAVINGS: $15.5M (86% cost reduction)
TIME SAVED: 13.5 years
```

**Break-even after:** First 2 applications

## Objections & Responses

### **"Our code is too complex for AI"**
**Response:** That's exactly what RAG solves. We index your entire codebase - business logic, dependencies, everything - giving the AI full context. We've successfully migrated apps with 200K+ lines of spaghetti code.

### **"What about our custom business rules?"**
**Response:** Osmosis extracts and preserves them. We generate comprehensive tests that validate all business logic before and after. You review the migration plan before any code is generated.

### **"We need Angular, not React"**
**Response:** Perfect - Osmosis generates React, Angular, Vue, or whatever you need. Same migration process, different output framework. Your choice.

### **"Security/Compliance concerns"**
**Response:** Osmosis can deploy on-premise in your VPC. Your code never leaves your infrastructure. We use YOUR LLM proxy. Full SOC2/HIPAA compliance.

### **"What's the catch?"**
**Response:** No catch. 10-20% of code needs human review/refinement. Complex business logic may need manual testing. We're transparent about what's automated vs manual.
